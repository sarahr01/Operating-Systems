Operating System Function #1: Starting Devices
Operating systems use the start up process to start a computer or mobile device. The startup process starts with an electrical current to the circuitry in the device. It ends with with the operating system in the memory taking control of the device and loading the system configuration information. Once it's complete, the computer or device is ready to be used. 

Operating System Function #2: Providing a User Interface (UI)
The operating system provides the user interface for the computer. The user interface controls how you enter data and instructions and how information is displayed on the screen. The two types of UI are Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command-line interface. GUI allows you to interact with menus and visual images by touching, tapping, pointing, or clicking buttons/objects to issue commands. Command-line interface allows you to type commands represented by short words or abbreviations and is used to configure devices and manage system resources.
